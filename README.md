# Goops

Experimental HCL Tool for performing configuration management actions on a server. It will only execute simple actions
as a proof of concept to begin. The idea behind Goops is to provide a more Terraform friendly approach to performing
Day-2 and configuration operations, which as of 0.12 of Terraform is not really well supported.

The idea is also to provide a simple executable that can perform the installation and processing of more complex actions
and ideally will be platform independent.

Initially it should be a alternative to Cloud-Init
